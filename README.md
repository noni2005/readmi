To make this easy salad recipe, you will need:

Greens: I typically use a bag of mixed spring greens for this salad, but any favorite greens will do.
Veggies: I kept things simple with just red onion and sliced pepperoncini peppers. But feel free to add in extra salad veggies that you have on hand!
Tomatoes: Any kind of fresh tomatoes would be great, or feel free to add some sun-dried tomatoes instead.
Croutons: Feel free to use any leftover bread that you have on hand to make a batch of homemade croutons. Or you can totally use store-bought croutons as well.
Parmesan: The more the merrier in this salad, if you ask me! I love tossing some into the big bowl of salad, plus grating extra on top of the individual salad servings as well.
(Optional) Nuts: We love adding a handful of toasted pine nuts into this salad too.
Italian Vinaigrette: A pantry-friendly combo of olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon, garlic (or garlic powder), dried oregano, salt and pepper.
